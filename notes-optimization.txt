Optimization:

If there are multiple plugin instances:
	- XHR requests :
		- if there are multiple URLs, we could use Promise.all
		- in my case, i stored category in variable, i could store different sports in different categories and use one call
	- Carousel initialization
		- i would wait with initializaion, unless there is some correct response data.
		- if we have one carousel for each sport, i would wait for data for correct sport and then initialized carousel.
